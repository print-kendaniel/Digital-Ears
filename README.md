# Digital Ears – Emotion Detection from Speech (MATLAB)

Digital Ears is a MATLAB-based system that analyzes speech signals and predicts human emotions using audio signal processing and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The system processes recorded speech by extracting Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which capture important spectral characteristics of human voice. These features are then used by a trained classification model to determine the expressed emotion.

## Features
- Speech input using WAV files or recorded audio
- MFCC-based feature extraction
- Emotion classification using a trained machine learning model
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user interaction
- Real-time emotion prediction display

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB
- Audio Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Machine Learning Toolbox

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run `main.m`
4. Use the GUI to load a sample audio file or record voice input
5. Click **Predict Emotion** to view the result
